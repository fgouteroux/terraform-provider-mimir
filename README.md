## Importing existing resources
This provider supports importing existing resources into the terraform state. Import is done according to the various provider/resource configuation settings to contact the API server and obtain data.

### mimir alerting rule group

To import mimir rule group alerting
The id is build as `<namespace>/<name>`

Example:

```
terraform import 'mimir_rule_group_alerting.alert1' namespace1/alert1
mimir_rule_group_alerting.alert1: Importing from ID "namespace1/alert1"...
mimir_rule_group_alerting.alert1: Import prepared!
  Prepared mimir_rule_group_alerting for import
mimir_rule_group_alerting.alert1: Refreshing state... [id=namespace1/alert1]

Import successful!

The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now in
your Terraform state and will henceforth be managed by Terraform.

```

### mimir recording rule group

To import mimir rule group recording
The id is build as `<namespace>/<name>`

mimir_rule_group_recording.record1: Import prepared!
  Prepared mimir_rule_group_recording for import
mimir_rule_group_recording.record1: Refreshing state... [id=namespace1/record1]

Import successful!
