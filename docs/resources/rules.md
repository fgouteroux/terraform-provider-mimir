  Manages multiple Grafana Mimir rule groups within a namespace.
          This resource is designed to handle YAML files containing multiple rule groups,
          such as those exported from mimirtool or monitoring mixins. Each rule group
          is managed individually via the Mimir API, but they are tracked together as
